I am delighted to share, that I've got a job at Mentor Graphics, where I'll be working as Embedded Software Engineer. I had worked there before for 6 months as university Intern and worked on some cool projects like Automated WLAN 802.11 testing and USB Connection Execiser (USB-connX), which will be used to enhance the work of team and add value to their existing mainstream projects which was extremely appreciated by everyone, and now I'll be joining the same team as a full time employee. This would be my first full time Job.

Those who don't know about [Mentor Graphics](https://www.mentor.com) [Now acquired by Siemens], It's an amazing Electronics Design Automation (EDA) company which deals in EDA softwares used by Semiconductor and System companies around the world. The other top players in this domain are Cadence and Synopsis. I've joined Automotive Business unit which is a part of Mentor Embedded. My role would be to work on Automotive Embedded devices- ADAS and IVI-systems based on industry renowned Mentor Embedded Linux and Connected OS and might get to work on the famous Mentor's RTOS- the nucleus. I am excited to start my journey as a professional Engineer now after completing my degree and contribute to growth and development of the company.
